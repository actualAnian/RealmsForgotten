People of knowledge, that mastered the old ways of arcane magic and Astronomy. The first elvish people arrived on this land and took hold of something precious from them." />
	<string id="rf_anorit_lord_text_7" text="And you can imagine the outcome. There was war. And the elvish people ended up victorious, but also almost decimated." />
	<string id="rf_anorit_lord_text_8" text="I have the belief that the whole of the Elvean songs are made up to make it believe." />
	<string id="rf_anorit_lord_text_9" text="That sounds not very reasonable…" />
	<string id="rf_anorit_lord_text_10" text="Are undead walking the world of living reasonable ? In some way, we are sure that this old elvean antagonists had not been totally exterminated. And all this time they were waiting for the chance to exact revenge." />

	<string id="rf_anorit_lord_text_12" text="Believe you or not, the undead walk the world of the living. You have seeing with your own eyes. And now also demons are crossing into our world." />
	<string id="rf_anorit_lord_text_13" text="Demons? And what is my place in all this madness ?" />
	<string id="rf_anorit_lord_text_14" text="That’s for you to decide. I am the master of the Anorites, an Order that dedicate itself to the truth of light, the force that lives in the heart of fire. We are here to protect the living. And maybe what you have on your hands can help us in our task to destroy this enemy." />
	<string id="rf_anorit_lord_text_15" text="And maybe not. Maybe I do have a map of a treasure, probably for an ancient civilization, and all you want is to grab it to bring it to your coffers." />
	<string id="rf_anorit_lord_text_16" text="The path of truth is the path of fire. If you are in the truth no harm you come to you. But if not, fire has no mercy.We wil be watching" />

	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_first_dialog_6" text="We could, but how far can we go only the two uf us? We need to alert Queens and Kings about this matter. I see no other way." />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_first_dialog_7" text="Yes, but how? Reporting we have demons marching into our world? Without any proof, we will be ridiculed!" />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_first_dialog_8" text="True... capturing the undead worked to have the Queen engaged. We need to find a similar way to convince them." />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_first_dialog_9" text="And not only the Realms of Men... IF we are indeed to confront more of such creatures, we need to look after all the kingdoms." />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_first_dialog_10" text="So we need something bigger, something that will leave no doubt... we need to capture some of these evil beings. But these cultists are something else. We need more than just a few soldiers." />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_first_dialog_11" text="Maybe stronger weapons?" />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_first_dialog_12" text="What do you mean?" />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_first_dialog_13" text="I've traveled far and wide, for many years serving as a spy and messenger for Queen Rinaia. Once I had come across a monastic order; they were known for their expertise with concotions. The common folk claimed they were holy people... What if not holy but sorcerers?" />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_first_dialog_14" text="Do you mean Magic? Pursuing magic is under penalty of death." />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_first_dialog_15" text="And yet, undead and demons? Do they make any more sense? They must be creatures born of magic, albeit a dark one...Magic or Faith, Holy Men or Sorcerers, whats the diference? The folk regard them to be of a good nature. We have nothing to loose." />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_first_dialog_16" text="I see... Where are we heading to?" />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_first_dialog_17" text="WEe need to travel to Borchovagorka. There at the hills we will find a monastery." />

	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_monk_dialog_1" text="Excuse me, sir. We've heard a lot about your deeds through the folk around these parts. They say you are holy men..." />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_monk_dialog_2" text="Good day, brother. These are kind words, but we are no holy people, only dedicated hermits. How can we serve you?" />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_monk_dialog_3" text="What we have to say may be difficult to swallow at first... We have recently been in battle, facing an enemy with an otherworldly nature... Aware that this probably would not reach the ears of Lords, we have no other choice but to seek counceling from those who walk the path of knowledge and spiritual matters..." />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_monk_dialog_4" text="Hmmm, I see. And to what otherworldly nature are you referring?" />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_monk_dialog_5" text="Beings not from this world. Demons." />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_monk_dialog_6" text="Demons?... The common folk have a plethora of them. But I sense enough seriousness on your gaze that gives me the impression you are not bringing this matter forth merely out of imagination." />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_monk_dialog_7" text="Absolutely not, sir. We barely escaped with our lives." />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_monk_dialog_8" text="I need to bring your claim to our council. But they will ask for more proof." />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_monk_dialog_9" text="I have found that in one of their hideouts. Take it." />
	
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_monk_dialog_10" text="How should i name you sir ?"/>
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_monk_dialog_11" text="My name is {PLAYER.LINK}."/>
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_monk_dialog_12" text="The artefact you have brought to us is something very rare. I am almost certain you do not know what it refers to. In the old era, there were a ruling civilization in Aeurth. I am talking about a time before the Elveans themselves. Many of our scholars dedicate to the study of their past and they have found very little accounts of that time, apart of some very rare sites, mostly scattered ruins."/>
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_monk_dialog_13" text="That stone tablet seems to contain a set of instructions, but we need more time to understand it. The interested of our order lies on the knowledge they had about nature and the movement of the stars. Maybe that can bring us closer to it... They seemed to be a highly developed culture."/>
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_monk_dialog_14" text="And how did they came to desappear leaving so little behind ?"/>
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_monk_dialog_15" text="That's something that still puzzle us. But we have found some evidence that binds the Elvean past to them. Where did you find it this artefact ?"/>
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_monk_dialog_16" text="It is a long story but to make it short, we were in a official mission. But we did not expect to come across supernatural creatures, much less to fight demons. And they were many. I fear that is threat to everyone, everywhere!"/>
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_monk_dialog_17" text="The existence of the undead is fact known for several years by now. But what kind of force is behind those abominations is still a mistery. The news of demons makes it worse..."/>
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_monk_dialog_18" text="That´s what brought as here, hoping to find help to defeat them. We aim to capture one of these creatures as proof to raise the Kingdoms against them, but our army have been reduced to the two of us."/>
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_monk_dialog_19" text="Indeed we are not only an order of monks, but a military one as well. And as alchemists we hold on weapons that can help. We will send you some of our men."/>
	
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_owl_dialog_1" text="You know, inside that mountain, I found something... I've been keeping it hidden." />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_owl_dialog_2" text="Hidden? What did you find?" />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_owl_dialog_3" text="I kept hidden cause i am not sure what is it. But after that attack, we were lucky that i havent lost i... It looked important, so I hid it." />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_owl_dialog_4" text="It is a kind of stone tablet, with inscriptions... Do you have any idea what it is ?" />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_owl_dialog_5" text="No clue. But it felt... significant. I think you should have it. After all, we wouldn't have made it out without you." />
	
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_hellbound_dialog_1" text="Who are you? What do you want?" />

	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_hellbound_dialog_npc_1" text="I already said. We are nothing but the shadows of days gone. The ghosts that came to calim vengeance." />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_hellbound_dialog_player_1_wrong" text="I advise you to open your mouth and tell me who you are before it can be closed forever." />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_hellbound_dialog_npc_1_wrong" text="Hahaha, do you think I am afraid of pain ? Your days are numbered." />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_hellbound_dialog_player_2" text="You don't know me either. I don't fight under any banner; I am the owner of my own destiny. If your cause is fair, I may follow." />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_hellbound_dialog_npc_2" text="Ah So you promise... The land you are standing over has been usurped from its original sons and daughters. For thousands of years, their bodies deep under the ice have been a prison for their souls, crying out for revenge. That is our cause. To bring justice to the usurpers." />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_hellbound_dialog_player_2_wrong" text="Whatever your cause is, it dwells in dark magic. The kind of creatures you are calling upon the world will bring only misery and destruction. It is better you reveal your plans, or I will extract them from you with pain..." />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_hellbound_dialog_npc_2_wrong" text="Hahaha, do you think I am afraid of pain? The pain that will unleash over the world is beyond your comprehension." />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_hellbound_dialog_player_5_success" text="Who are the usurpers ?" />
	<string id="rf_fourth_quest_hellbound_dialog_npc_5_success" text="You know nothing about this world. Those who call themselves the firstborn, who pretend to be the carriers of light and good. Their forefathers were assassins, erasing thousands of lives to steal a land that did not belong to them. But that's enough, I have nothing else to say. The dawn of time is upon us..." />
