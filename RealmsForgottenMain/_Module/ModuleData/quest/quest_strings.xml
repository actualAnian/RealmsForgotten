Instead, they perceived the universe through the lens of negative and positive forces, both essential to the delicate equilibrium of the world... In this manner, the Vortiak priests nurtured a pantheon divided between gods of creation and gods of destruction.

Our order has found some of these relics, and we have learned much from them to enhance our healing arts... We believe that those relics have also taken the form of weapons.

	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_belvor_king_dialog_10_2" text="What sorcery is this? That blade do looks like something rare, but means naught to me! If thou seek to sway my people's hearts, thou must bring forth a treasure dear to them."/>

	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_belvor_king_dialog_12" text="A treasure of our people, the crown of King Ulvor...And to sway my will, a head of one of those evil!"/>

	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_owl_treasure_1" text="Well, if we have to find a treasure that could be of importance to the king, the only thing that comes to my mind is to search for somebody I have met."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_owl_treasure_2" text="And who would that be?"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_owl_treasure_3" text="When we first met, I was chatting with that suspicious figure who claims to deal with relics and items that have magic powers... It sounds like an obvious lead, doesn't it?"/>

	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_owl_treasure_5" text="I believe so. And I also believe he doesn't work alone."/>

	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_vendor_treasure_1" text="Greetings, stranger. What can I do for you?"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_vendor_treasure_2" text="We are looking for a special item, and we heard that's exactly your job. We're searching for the crown of King Ulvor."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_vendor_treasure_3" text="Ahhh, this one... You've managed to be both lucky and unlucky at the same time. I did get my hands on that relic, yes, but some time ago... It was actually delivered to someone of noble birth, none other than the Khan of the AllKhuur. It happened to be a gift for his coming of age."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_vendor_treasure_4" text="Why him? Why not King Belvor?"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_vendor_treasure_5" text="I don't know... Khuurens are a very esoteric folk, with their spirits and entities. Who knows what the Khan would do with that relic? Perhaps indulge in mystical powers over the Realms of Men? Anyway, that's all I have to tell you."/>
	
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_owl_treasure_1_1" text="All Khuurens kings have a tradition to celebrate their birthday at their sacred temple, at the great lake. If we have to go somewhere, we should start there."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_owl_treasure_1_2" text="But I suppose that temple will be heavily guarded. So it seems more fight is underway."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_owl_treasure_1_3" text="Or maybe we can sneak inside, and if it's there, we steal it and run."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_owl_treasure_1_4" text="I hope so."/>

	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_1" text="For what reason dost thou cross my path, stranger? It must needs be a weighty cause."/>

	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_answer_1" text="Nay, Milord, we have delved deep and consulted sages who can vouch for our claims!"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_answer_2" text="Milord, we possess a rarity that may shed light upon this darkness."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_reply_1" text="And where be these sages now? The greatest savants of Aeurth are the priests of the High Kingdom. Why hath this threat not been brought afore me?"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_reply_2" text="Indeed? And where might it be found?"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_answer_3_wrong" text="They reside far hence, Milord, belonging to an order that shuns the world's affairs. Yet they hold ancient wisdom."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_answer_4" text="Behold, Milord, a blade I found in the bowels of a mountain, guarded by the strangest of beasts…"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_reply_3" text="Dost thou claim these sages commune with the departed...? I should tear thy tongue for bringing such folly to my court. Begone, or I shall have thee imprisoned!"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_reply_4" text="What sorcery is this? That blade belongs to mine ancestors! How came it into thy possession?"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_answer_5_wrong" text="As thou commandest, Milord, I shall depart forthwith."/>

	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_fourth_dialog_2" text="I sense a peculiar power, almost as if it's alive...
