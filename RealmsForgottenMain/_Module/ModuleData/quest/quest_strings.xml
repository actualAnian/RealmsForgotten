	<string id="rf_third_quest_scholar_dialog_12" text="{=rf_third_quest_scholar_dialog_12}Now? Why the rush?" />

	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_second_dialog_3" text="He revealed things but not as much as I desire. The undead, they are indeed the warriors who perished in the war with the elveans. They were known as the Vortiaks. However, this prisoner is not serving the undead. They serve different masters." />

	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_second_dialog_5" text="The names he whispered carry the weight of ancient power, tied closely to the Old Gods. In the old era, the concepts of good and evil were not as clear-cut as we think. Instead, they perceived the universe through the lens of negative and positive forces, both essential to the delicate equilibrium of the world. In this manner, the ancient priests nurtured a pantheon divided between gods of creation and gods of destruction. I am led to believe they are trying to bring those latter forces to wreak havoc upon the world." />
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_second_dialog_6" text="That doesn't sound very good... So, this sect is trying to bring those gods into our world?" />

	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_second_dialog_11" text="To cleanse? The Argothes are the embodiment of destruction, the necessary stage before anything new can be reborn." />
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_second_dialog_12" text="These Vortiaks, when did they actually exist?" />
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_second_dialog_13" text="According to Elvean, their ancestors arrived around 2000 years ago. If they faced war, than i suppose that is the time." />

	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_second_dialog_17" text="It is up to you... If the those cultists are indeed so powerful, as you've already witnessed, and 'demons' are running wild, they need to be stopped." />
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_second_dialog_18" text="How can I stop such a supernatural force?" />
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_second_dialog_19" text="I don't know. What I do know is that the time of the Vortiaks was known as the Era of the Dragon's Moon. Under that moon, magic was alive, and the world was populated with wondrous beasts. At that time, it was used to create relics where magic could be stored. Our order has found some of these relics, and we have learned much from them to enhance our healing arts. We believe that those relics have also taken the form of weapons. Beneath the snow and ice, where we see only cold, lie the ruins and old palaces of the Vortiaks, unknown to men." />
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_second_dialog_20" text="We need more than that to begin with!" />
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_second_dialog_21" text="I think I know a place where you could start." />

	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_second_dialog_24" text="I see, even if I find a weapon there, I don’t think that will be enough. We need all the armies of the world if we are to face such power." />
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_second_dialog_25" text="Yes, you're right. But maybe in possession of something from the old world, we could have the attention we need." />

	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_third_dialog_2" text="I feel a strange power coming from this lance. If what we have been told holds true,that in the days of yore, the Elveans and the Vortiaks waged dire war, we should seek audience with the Elvean king. But we must tread with care..." />

	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_belvor_king_dialog_5" text="Hahahahha... that is all I need to hear. Amidst wars aplenty, now I must contend with unearthly malice." />
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_belvor_king_dialog_6" text="With respect, Your Majesty, what we speak is true... and we believe they may be kin to ancient adversaries of the Elveans, a folk once known as 'the Vortiaks'." />
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_belvor_king_dialog_7" text="Watch thy tongue, stranger, lest thou spout blasphemies that may cost your life!" />
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_belvor_king_dialog_7_1" text="Nay, Your Majesty, i mean no offense. we have sought counsel from the learned, who vouch for our claims!" />
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_belvor_king_dialog_7_2" text="Your Majesty, we possess an artifact rare, which may illuminate my words." />
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_belvor_king_dialog_8_1" text="And where are these learned folk now? The wisest sages of Aeurth reside within my domain. If thats true i wonder why has this threat not been brought before me?" />
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_belvor_king_dialog_8_2" text="Indeed? And where might this artifact be found?" />
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_belvor_king_dialog_9_1" text="They dwell afar, Your Majesty, members of an order who shun worldly affairs. Yet they hold ancient wisdom." />
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_belvor_king_dialog_9_2" text="Behold, Your Majesty, a blade that almost cost my life to retrieve." />
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_belvor_king_dialog_10_1" text="Dost thou claim these sages commune with the dead? I should have thee removed for bringing such folly to my presence. Depart, or face imprisonment!" />
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_belvor_king_dialog_10_2" text="What trickery is this? That blade means naught to me! If thou seek to sway my heart by presenting a gift, thou must bring forth a treasure dear to the Realms."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_belvor_king_dialog_11" text="And what would that be, milord?"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_belvor_king_dialog_12" text="A real relic to our people, the shield of King Ulvor!"/>

	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_owl_treasure_1" text="If we are to unearth a relic of significance to the king, one thought strikes me—I must seek out an acquaintance of mine."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_owl_treasure_2" text="And who, is this acquaintance?"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_owl_treasure_3" text="When we first crossed paths, I spoke with a that misterious figure who professes to trade in relics and enchanted items... It seems an obvious lead, does it not?"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_owl_treasure_4" text="Indeed, it does. Do you believe we shall find him there once more?"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_owl_treasure_5" text="I do."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_vendor_treasure_1" text="Greetings, traveler. How may I be of service to you?"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_vendor_treasure_2" text="We seek a particular item, a task suited to your reputed skills. We are in search of King Ulvor's shield."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_vendor_treasure_3" text="Ah, the shield... Your fortune is as double-edged as an elvean blade. I did possess that relic, once, but it has since passed into the hands of nobility—delivered to the Khan of the AllKhuur as a gift for his coming of age."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_vendor_treasure_4" text="Why bestow it upon him? Why not King Belvor?"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_vendor_treasure_5" text="The ways of the Khuurens are enigmatic, steeped in spirits and ancient rites. What the Khan intends for that relic is beyond my ken. Perhaps he seeks dominion over the Realms of Men? That is all I know."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_owl_treasure_1_1" text="The Khans of the AllKhuur hold a sacred tradition, celebrating their birthdays at their hallowed temple by the great lake. If we are to begin our search, it must be there."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_owl_treasure_1_2" text="Yet, I fear that temple will be heavily guarded. Another battle may be inevitable."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_owl_treasure_1_3" text="Or perhaps we might slip inside unnoticed, pilfer the relic, and make our escape."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_owl_treasure_1_4" text="Let us hope it is so."/>

	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_1" text="For what cause you intrude upon my realm, stranger? The matter must be of grave import."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_2" text="Hail, Milord. We bring dire news. We have encountered foes beyond mortal understanding, creatures not of this world. We fear they are amassing an army to challenge all living things."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_3" text="Haha, a curious tale indeed... And what force might stand against my host?"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_4" text="With all respect, Milord, demons, spawns of darkness…"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_5" text="Hahahaha... as if my current wars were not enough, now I must contend with supernatural malice…"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_6" text="With all respect, Milord, what we speak is true... we believe these creatures are kin to the ancient enemies of the Elveans, known as 'the Vortiaks'..."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_7" text="Tread carefully, stranger, lest thy words of blasphemy cost thee thy head!"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_answer_1" text="Nay, Milord, we have sought the counsel of sages who can attest to our claims!"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_answer_2" text="Milord, we possess an artifact that may illuminate this dark menace."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_reply_1" text="And where be these sages now? The wisest scholars of Aeurth reside within the High Kingdom's temples. Why hath this threat not reached my ears?"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_reply_2" text="Indeed? And where might this artifact be found?"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_answer_3_wrong" text="They dwell far from here, Milord, members of an order that eschews the world’s affairs. Yet their knowledge is ancient."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_answer_4" text="Behold, Milord, a blade unearthed from the depths of a mountain, guarded by the strangest of beasts…"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_reply_3" text="Dost thou claim these sages commune with the dead...? I should have thy tongue torn out for such folly. Begone, or face imprisonment!"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_reply_4" text="What sorcery is this? That blade belongs to mine ancestors! How came it into thy possession?"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_answer_5_wrong" text="As thou commandest, Milord, I shall depart forthwith."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_answer_6" text="Through battle and perseverance against these creatures, it came to me. I believe it is vital in our struggle against this evil!"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_8" text="That blade is a relic of our kin. If it has found its way to you, our ancestors must have deemed it so and blessed thee. Given this evil's strength, you shalt have our forces at your side, when the time comes. Until them, you can keep that weapon."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_9" text="I shall undertake the mission to rally support from other sovereigns."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_king_dialog_10" text="May our ancestors guide thee on thy path!"/>

	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_fail_dialog_1" text="We must not falter. Let us seek out the King of Men, King Belvor II."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_fourth_dialog_1" text="And now, where shall we journey?"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_fourth_dialog_2" text="I feel a strange power, almost sentient... If the old tales hold any truth, the Elveans and the Vortiaks once waged a terrible war. We must seek an audience with King Belvor II. Yet we must be cautious; who knows what dangers lie in wait..."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_fourth_dialog_3" text="It does seem true, and I sense imminent peril. What if this secret is meant to remain hidden? It could spell our doom..."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_fourth_dialog_4" text="'Tis a risk we must take."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_elvean_fail_owl" text="Alas, our plea has fallen on deaf ears. The Elveans will not join our cause. We must seek aid elsewhere."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_belvor_fail_owl" text="The King of Men remains unconvinced. We must look to other allies."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_nasorian_fail_owl" text="The Nasorians have rejected our entreaty. We must find another way."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_fifth_dialog_1" text="Time slips away, and I fear the demons grow stronger. Can we afford to spend more time persuading the other kings? What if they all demand proof of our claims?"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_fifth_dialog_2" text="That is likely... We need to muster forces by other means, be it mercenaries or persuaded prisoners. What matters is that we must bring down one of the lords of this evil and present him as a captive to the other kings."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_fifth_dialog_3" text="That seems the most direct path we can take. May the gods be with us."/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_treasure_fight_1" text="What are you doing? This is a sacred relic! Return it at once!"/>
	<string id="rf_fifth_quest_treasure_fight_2" text="Make me."/>

	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_first_dialog_5" text="Yes, we have endured more than expected together. It is time you learn more of my past. I serve neither Queen Rinaia nor the Anorite lord. My great-grandfather was a scholar, one of the founders of the Celestial Alchemists. In his travels for rare materials, he discovered ancient ruins and texts that obsessed him. This obsession led him to dark arts..."/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_first_dialog_6" text="Hmmm..."/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_first_dialog_7" text="My father left us before I came of age. After my mother's death, I sought my family's past and my father's fate. That led me to the black-robed cult and their hideouts. I offered my findings to the queen, hoping she would invest in uncovering their secrets. That is when you entered the scene. It took nearly my whole life to reach the point to be at that tavern where we first met."/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_first_dialog_8" text="Were you responsible for my imprisonment?"/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_first_dialog_9" text="Yes... I had to. I needed you out of the way to research those maps. What if my father is part of this? What if this cult is my legacy?"/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_first_dialog_10" text="I should break your nose here and now, but the past is done. You have proven yourself a brave warrior. We have much to do, and I have one idea left. We must face the King of the Dead."/>

	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_first_dialog_12" text="If anything can turn the tide of this war, it is him. Who better to face the powers of hell than the dead themselves? We must convince him to join our cause."/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_lord_dialog_1" text="Stranger, do you know you risk your head approaching me?"/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_lord_dialog_2" text="Yes, Milord, your reputation precedes you. But the matter I bring has already risked my life many times, and I am willing to sacrifice it if necessary. I bring news of a dark power invading our world and I believe you hold your land dear."/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_lord_dialog_3" text="Do you know you speak to death itself? What dark powers should I fear? These demons? Yes, I fight them, but only because they attack my people. I believe they are sent to cleanse Aeurth of the usurpers, the parasites who have taken hold of it."/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_lord_dialog_4" text="Pardon my ignorance, Milord, but I do not grasp your meaning."/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_lord_dialog_5" text="Our folk, buried under the snow, defeated by invaders who poisoned our sacred garden. They seized a place our people revered, where the life force of the world was balanced. They planted their seeds there, and from it, that Tree grew. It drains the world's vitality, empowering them with magic and longevity. Somehow, the world's spirits do not let our souls rest. The reason is clear: the extermination of the Elveans."/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_lord_dialog_6" text="Milord, I now know the tragic history of your people. But I believe this evil will destroy everything we hold dear, leaving no memory of anything. Is there nothing you wish to see flourish in this world?"/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_lord_dialog_7" text="Clever and honest words... Yes, memories are all we have. But our people are gone; nothing remains to flourish. We are here to avenge our ancestors so we can rest in peace."/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_lord_dialog_8" text="What if some of the Vortiak bloodline still exists? A descendant of the past, living among us all these years?"/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_lord_dialog_9" text="That is impossible..."/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_lord_dialog_10" text="Yes, Milord, it is true. And he stands beside me. I believe his ancestors brought this evil to avenge your people. But they became corrupted and lost their way. We must defeat this evil to bring their souls to light!"/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_lord_dialog_11" text="If that is true, and our legacy continues, we shall find peace at last. If not, your head will hang at my Hall's door, and your soul will never find peace."/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_lord_dialog_12" text="Please, Milord, all I ask is a chance. Make peace with the others so we can fight this evil together."/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_lord_dialog_13" text="Hmmm... Aye, I am convinced. I will hold peace until this evil is vanquished. If you are lying, I will hunt you myself."/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_lord_dialog_14" text="Thank you, Milord. I will not disappoint you. One more thing. I ask for some of your army. With your forces, I will hunt down the Lords of this evil."/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_lord_dialog_15" text="You are insolent, but brave. I shall lend you an army."/>

	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_second_dialog_1" text="What was that? What...what have you done? You've placed our heads at his mercy with a lie?"/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_second_dialog_2" text="What face is that? How can you be so certain what i say it's a lie? I've pondered this tale since the beginning, and your recent revelation about your past was the missing piece. The monk at the monastery suggested there must be a reason for those cultists to embrace such evil. And for me no more obvious than they be the descendents from the Vortiaks. What sort of people would invoke the old gods of that extinct civilization if not for a compelling reason? Only those connected to them by blood."/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_second_dialog_3" text="I...I don't know what to say."/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_second_dialog_4" text="I am certain all answers will reveal themselves. I feel we will encounter your father, or someone related to him and your ancestors. But first, we must vanquish this evil. We need to hunt down the leaders of these armies and cut them down."/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_second_dialog_5" text="I am...a bit lost now."/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_second_dialog_6" text="Steady yourself. One step at a time. Let's finish them!"/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_after_demon_lords_defeated_owl_dialog_1" text="I can scarcely believe what has transpired! We vanquished those fiends! By the gods, that blade you wield must hail from another realm!"/>
	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_after_demon_lords_defeated_owl_dialog_2" text="Indeed, it feels like a miracle... yet I dare not declare this war over. We must ensure not a single demon remains. Messengers must be dispatched to the kings, gathering all knowledge about the unseen threats."/>

	<string id="rf_sixth_quest_after_demon_lords_defeated_owl_dialog_4" text="But remember, we must also hunt down the Cultists and uncover the fate of your father."/>
